Timestamp (when this report was generated)
	•	Local time (your system): Friday, October 03, 2025 — 09:43:55 AM (America/Los_Angeles / PDT)
	•	Eastern Time (US) — current local Eastern time zone: 12:43:55 PM EDT (UTC−4), October 03, 2025
	•	If you specifically require EST (UTC−5) instead of the currently active EDT, that corresponds to: 11:43:55 AM EST (UTC−5), October 03, 2025

What I did / Who did it
	•	Author: You (self-performed)
	•	Tool name: st-osint2 (project name / handle)
	•	What: Created a harmless Python script (usb_inf.py) that generates device-like, fake data lines for demo/visualization. The script prints a colored banner (optional), then prints timestamped, single-line entries with a colored prefix and a tilde in orange. No real scanning or destructive activity is performed.

⸻

Output format (example lines — timestamps shown in Eastern Time)

Each output line is printed as a single line with prefix and a short fake info item. Times below use Eastern Time (EDT / EST notes above).

[12:43:55] [INFO] ~ Hostname: qwerty.local
[12:43:56] [INFO] ~ User: user4821
[12:43:57] [INFO] ~ Email: alpha@kjdle.org
[12:43:58] [INFO] ~ IPv4: 10.5.212.43
[12:43:59] [INFO] ~ MAC: 3A:7F:4C:AA:12:09

(Actual values are randomly generated by the script; these lines are sample formatting only.)

⸻

Fields generated by generate_info_full() (complete set included in the code)
	•	Hostname, Username, Email, Website
	•	IPv4, IPv6, MAC, Router, DNS, Altitude, GPS
	•	City, Country, DNI, Age, Gender
	•	Password, Access Token, Card Number, Phone, Provider
	•	OS, Device, IMEI, Cookies, UID, Device ID
	•	Fingerprint, Iris ID, Face Hash, Social Number
	•	Bank, BIOS Hash, Kernel Version, Battery, WiFi SSID
	•	Network Detected, Uptime Hours

⸻

How the banner and colors work
	•	The script exposes a banner() / banner_text variable you edit to place your own ASCII art or message.
	•	When printing the banner, if lolcat is installed, the script pipes the banner into lolcat so it shows full color. Otherwise the banner prints plain.
	•	Each info line is prefixed with: [HH:MM:SS] [INFO] ~ — the prefix is blue, and the ~ is orange for visual emphasis.

⸻

Run instructions (Termux)
	1.	Ensure Python 3 installed: pkg install python
	2.	(Optional) Install lolcat for colored banners: pkg install ruby then gem install lolcat
	3.	Save the script as usb_inf.py and edit the banner_text variable at the top.
	4.	Run: python3 usb_inf.py
	5.	Choose option 1 to produce the single-pass output lines (one line per fake field, spaced by the configured delay).

⸻

Safety & ethics note
	•	The code is intentionally non-destructive. Wipe-related functionality is explicitly disabled and replaced with safe status messages.
	•	Use the generator responsibly: it produces fake/sample data for display, testing UI, or training demos only. Do not use generated data to impersonate, phish, or otherwise harm people.

⸻

Extras you may want to add
	•	Export to JSON/CSV for analysis or demo logs.
	•	Option to set number of lines and delay via CLI arguments.
	•	Read banner from an environment variable or external file for easier updates.
	•	Add a short README that documents the script’s safe mode and the list of generated fields.
